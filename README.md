Through this project we try to assign soccer players with ids which would remain consistent throughout the match. We tried different tracking tracking methods, starting with Deepsort then moving to StrongSort. With both almost a same level of satisfactory performance was been able to be achieved. In this github upload we have kept the Deepsort version, though everyone is welcome to reach out for the StrongSort version.

To run:
